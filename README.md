# celsvs-api-tests
celsvs-api-tests is the repo for Celsvs library Manager REST API tests. TestNG base tests based on rest-assure library.

To run the tests it is assumed that the application is already running, not being part of the Celsvs application maven project. In IDE TestNG plugin + embedded Tomcat server will do the job, but the applicaton must be started first (as Spring Boot Web app), before the tests can be run.
